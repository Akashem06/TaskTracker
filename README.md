# Task Tracker

A Python script and a counterpart React Web app to record time spent on each app, personalized to fit my needs. <br>
This was made to bring awareness to how I manage my time. ðŸ•’

## How does it work?

* Once the Python script is running, it will run through a while loop where it will check whether the user has changed tabs or not. <br>
* If they have changed tabs it will then send a POST request containing information on the time spent and the app name. <br>
* Before the information is added to the SQL database, the backend will first check if the app has already been logged. <br>
* If it has been logged, it will generate a new sum of the total time spent on the app. <br>
* The React web app will display the information. <br>

* The full CRUD API uses Axios to send JSON requests to the SQL database which is updated. <br>
* The frontend application is live updated through the use of a context API.
